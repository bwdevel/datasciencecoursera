# run_analysis.R

***

## Project for:
### Getting and Cleaning Data
#### For the Data Science Certificate Program
#### at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health

***

This project contains a single R script that reads in a set of mobile device data, extracts the mean and standard deviation fields, cleans the dataset and outputs to a single text file named: `tiny.data.txt`

The file requires the data set provided for the project as outlined in the `CODEBOOK.md`

The outline of the project is as follow:

> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
>
> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
